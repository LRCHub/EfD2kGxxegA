I don't know, if you ever felt the same as me
It would be mean
Not to tell me
Why did you play with my heart?
No no no no

Ice kisses, they are like a taste of holy rum
Sweet and cold boy, crystalline
And too grey i know you know
No no no no

Give me many kisses, let it go
I'm so happy to be hooked on
Give me many kisses, let it go
I'm so happy to be hooked on, happy to be hooked on you

Now i know, what's the meaning of your life for me?
It would be mean
Not to tell me
Why did you play with my heart?
No no no no

Ice kisses, they are like a taste of holy rum
Sweet and cold boy, crystalline
And too grey i know you know
No no no no

Give me many kisses, let it show
I'm so happy to be hooked on
Give me many kisses, let it go
I'm so happy to be hooked on
Happy to be hooked on you
